Optimality analysis (why binary search)
Problem type: Dictionary word lookup (find the index of a word in
a sorted list).
Greedy rationale: Binary search repeatedly selects the middle element of the
current search interval and eliminates half of the remaining elements based
on comparison with the target. This works because the list is sorted:
if the target is less than the middle element, it must be in the left half;
if greater, it must be in the right half. Each local choice safely reduces
the search space without missing the target, guaranteeing that the correct
index is found or confirmed absent.

Complexity:
	•	Reading the dictionary: O(N * L) time, O(N * L) space, where N is the
    number of words and L is the average word length.
	•	Binary search lookup: O(L * log N) time, O(log N) space for recursion.
	•	Input processing and output: O(L) time and space.
	•	Overall: O(N * L + L * log N) time, O(N * L + log N) space.

Limitations:
	•	The algorithm requires the dictionary to be sorted; otherwise,
    binary search fails.
	•	Recursion depth is limited by the stack; for extremely large
    dictionaries, an iterative binary search may be safer.
	•	Searching for multiple words individually is less efficient than
    preprocessing with a hash table, which allows O(L) lookup per word but
    requires extra memory.
