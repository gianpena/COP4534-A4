Optimality analysis
Problem type: Square matrix multiplication (size n × n)
Greedy rationale: Strassen’s algorithm reduces the number of recursive
multiplications from 8 (in standard divide-and-conquer) to 7 by computing
cleverly combined submatrix products (M1–M7). Each local choice of combining
submatrices ensures that all elements of the final product are correctly
computed. This reduction is safe because linear combinations of submatrices
preserve the matrix product identity, guaranteeing correctness while decreasing
recursive calls.

Complexity:
	•	Recursive multiplications: T(n) = 7·T(n/2) + O(n²) for matrix addition/subtraction.
	•	Using the Master Theorem: T(n) = O(n^log₂7) ≈ O(n^2.807).
	•	Space complexity: O(n²) for storing submatrices and the final product at
    each recursion level.

Limitations:
	•	Works only for square matrices of dimensions that are powers of 2;
    otherwise, padding is required.
	•	Overhead from slicing submatrices and repeated additions can dominate
    for small matrices; classical O(n³) multiplication can be faster for small n.
	•	Recursive depth is log₂n, which could be a concern for very large
    matrices in languages with limited recursion stack.
